#CellEx - Gruppo 1
Progetto per Esame Ingegneria del Software A.A. 2015/2016
(Ingegneria Informatica - Università di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale)

#Introduction
This project involves the construction of a client / server based system. This system is designed to simplify the exams’ registration process by professors of a university. This project is user-friendly and requires a minimum and a basic knowledge. An admin gives to professors, which are registered in a database called S3, an ID and a password, in order to enable and store them in the system. After this registration, the professors can sign the exams, which are also store in the system. 

#Motivation
The dematerialization’s process of paper documents and the innovation of administrative procedures of a university wanted to make a significant leap forward replacing the current paper-based examination forms with a new registration system of examinations based on the use of an automated system, called CellEx.

#Installation
To use this software, it is recommended to import the project into a development environment such as Eclipse or Netbeans. To launch the software, run the file Server.java, which is in the package    "it.uniclam.ids.gruppo1.registrazioneesami", then run the file ClientMainGUI.java to show the GUI display.

#API Reference
